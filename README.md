## Installation

You can install the development version of biostoreCapacity from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mshilts1/biostoreCapacity")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(biostoreCapacity)
```

The simplest equation for calculating BioStore capacity is:

$((196,412 + x)/788,256) + ((212,692 + y)/438,840)) = 1$

where:  
\* $196,412$ is the current number of 1.0 ml tubes already stored (or
pending storage) in the BioStore (as of 2025-09-02).  
\* $x$ is the number of 1.0 ml tubes still to be collected for ECHO.  
\* $212,692$ is the current number of 1.9 ml tubes already stored (or
pending storage) in the BioStore (as of 2025-09-02).  
\* $y$ is the number of 1.9 ml tubes still to be collected ECHO.  
\* $788,256$ is the absolute maximum number of 1.0 ml tubes that be
stored in the BioStore (assuming 0 1.9 ml tubes).  
\* $438,840$ is the absolute maximum number of 1.0 ml tubes that be
stored in the BioStore (assuming 0 1.9 ml tubes).
